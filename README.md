# Bank Marketing Data Sciences Project


## Introduction : 

This repository contains the code for our project **Bank Marketing**, developed during our [Data Scientist training](https://datascientest.com/en/data-scientist-course) at [DataScientest](https://datascientest.com/).

## Presentation

The analysis of marketing data from a banking or financial institution is one of the most common applications of Data Science and Machine Learning. The dataset on which we will work presents personal data of customers of a bank who have been
of a bank who have been "telemarked" in order to subscribe to a product called "term deposit". A time deposit is an account in which the customer does not touch the deposited funds for a defined period of time
for a defined period of time in exchange for interest that they earn at the end of the term. This would be a product that would not be of interest to all of the bank's customers since sufficient savings are required to deposit in the term deposit account in question.
The purpose of our study will answer the following question: Which customers are likely to open
likely to open term deposit accounts? Also, it will be fundamental to be able to interpret our predictions by explaining why a client is considered to subscribe or not.
To answer this question, we will first analyze the data in order to get some initial answers.
In order to answer this question, we will first analyze the data to obtain the first elements of answers and carry out the necessary pre-processing for the rest of our study. Secondly, we will try to define a predictive model that will allow us to predict the customers who have subscribed to a term deposit. We will then proceed with the interpretation of our model. And to conclude, we will propose recommendations to
improve future campaigns
